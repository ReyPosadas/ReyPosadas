**MyToken - Final-assessment-Solidity**
This Solidity program is a program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to get a feel for how it works.
**Description**
The Solidity program contract "MyToken" is a simple smart contract for creating a cryptocurrency token on the Ethereum blockchain. It has two public string variables for the token name and abbreviation, and a public uint variable to track the total supply of tokens. The contract uses a mapping to store the balance of tokens for each address that holds them. The contract also includes two functions: "mint" for creating new tokens and assigning them to an address, and "burn" for removing tokens from an address. This contract provides a basic framework for managing a token on the Ethereum blockchain.
**Executing program**
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file: contract MyToken {
